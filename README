NAME
    ssh-ident - Start and use ssh-agent and load identities as necessary.

FILE
    ssh-ident

DESCRIPTION
    Use this script to start ssh-agents and load ssh keys on demand,
    when they are first needed.

    All you have to do is modify your .bashrc to have:

      alias ssh='/path/to/ssh-ident'

    or add a link to ssh-ident from a directory in your PATH, for example:

      ln -s /path/to/ssh-ident ~/bin/ssh

    If you use scp or rsync regularly, you should add a few more lines described
    below.

    In any case, ssh-ident:

    - will create an ssh-agent and load the keys you need the first time you
      actually need them, once. No matter how many terminals, ssh or login
      sessions you have, no matter if your home is shared via NFS.

    - can prepare and use a different agent, different set of keys and different
      ssh config file depending on the host you are connecting to, or the
      directory you are using ssh from.
      This allows for isolating keys when using agent forwarding with different
      sites (eg, university, work, home, secret evil internet identity, ...).
      It also allows to use multiple accounts on sites like github, unfuddle
      and gitorious easily.

    - allows to specify different options for each set of keys. For example, you
      can provide a -t 60 to keep keys loaded for at most 60 seconds. Or -c to
      always ask for confirmation before using a key.


    Installation
    ============

    All you need to run ssh-ident is a standard installation of python 2 (>= 2.6).
    Python 3 is supported, but newer versions may deprecate stuff and will fail.

    If your system has wget and are impatient to use it, you can install
    ssh-ident with two simple commands:

       mkdir -p ~/bin; wget -O ~/bin/ssh goo.gl/MoJuKB; chmod 0755 ~/bin/ssh

       echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.bashrc

    Logout, login, and done. SSH should now invoke ssh-ident instead of the
    standard ssh.


    Alternatives
    ============

    In .bashrc, I have:

      alias ssh=/home/ccontavalli/scripts/ssh-ident

    all I have to do now is logout, login and then:

      $ ssh somewhere

    ssh-ident will be called instead of ssh, and it will:
    - check if an agent is running. If not, it will start one.
    - try to load all the keys in ~/.ssh, if not loaded.

    If I now ssh again, or somewhere else, ssh-ident will reuse the same agent
    and the same keys, if valid.


    About scp, rsync, and friends
    =============================

    scp, rsync, and most similar tools internally invoke ssh. If you don't tell
    them to use ssh-ident instead, key loading won't work. There are a few ways
    to solve the problem:

    1) Rename 'ssh-ident' to 'ssh' or create a symlink 'ssh' pointing to
       ssh-ident in a directory in your PATH before /usr/bin or /bin, similarly
       to what was described previously. For example, add to your .bashrc:

        export PATH="${HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

       And run:

        ln -s /path/to/ssh-ident ~/bin/ssh

       Make sure `echo ${PATH}` shows '~/bin' *before* '/usr/bin' or '/bin'. You
       can verify this is working as expected with `which ssh`, which should
       show ~/bin/ssh.

       This works for rsync and git, among others, but not for scp and sftp, as
       these do not look for ssh in your PATH but use a hard-coded path to the
       binary.

       If you want to use ssh-ident with scp or sftp,  you can simply create
       symlinks for them as well:

        ln -s /path/to/ssh-ident ~/bin/scp
        ln -s /path/to/ssh-ident ~/bin/sftp

       It is not recommended to create symlinks for 'ssh-agent' and 'ssh-add'.

    2) Add a few more aliases in your .bashrc file, for example:

        alias scp="BINARY_SSH='scp' '/path/to/ssh-ident'"
        alias rsync="BINARY_SSH='rsync' '/path/to/ssh-ident'"
        alias ssh-add="BINARY_SSH='ssh-add' '/path/to/ssh-ident'"
        alias ssh-agent="BINARY_SSH='ssh-agent' '/path/to/ssh-ident'"

        ...

       The first alias will make the 'scp' command invoke 'ssh-ident' instead,
       but tell 'ssh-ident' to invoke 'scp' instead of the plain 'ssh' command
       after loading the necessary agents and keys.

       Note that aliases don't work from scripts - if you have any script that
       you expect to use with ssh-ident, you may prefer method 1), or you will
       need to update the script accordingly.

       For the ssh-agent and ssh-add binaries the first parameter can be
       '-i/-I <identity>' to use them with a non-default identity.
       Note that with '-i' (lowercase) no keys will be loaded for ssh-agent
       and ssh-add calls.

         BINARY_SSH='ssh-agent' /path/to/ssh-ident <-i|-I> <identity> ...
         BINARY_SSH='ssh-add' /path/to/ssh-ident <-i|-I> <identity> ...

       Additionally the identity can be defined via SSH_IDENT_ID='<identity>'.

    3) Use command specific methods to force them to use ssh-ident instead of
       ssh, for example:

        rsync -e '/path/to/ssh-ident' ...
        scp -S '/path/to/ssh-ident' ...

    4) Replace the real ssh on the system with ssh-ident, and set the
       BINARY_SSH configuration parameter to the original value.

       On Debian based system, you can make this change in a way that
       will survive automated upgrades and audits by running:

         dpkg-divert --divert /usr/bin/ssh.ssh-ident --rename /usr/bin/ssh

       After which, you will need to use:

         BINARY_SSH="/usr/bin/ssh.ssh-ident"

    5) Identities can also be used like a normal ssh-agent and helps in some
       special cases, where programs use an ssh library and do not call the ssh
       binaries.
       Make sure the agent for the identity is running and keys are loaded via
       ssh-add -I (uppercase). After this just source the agent environment file
       of the identity and execute the program.
       That's the same way as using pure ssh-agent, where you also have to make
       sure to have the correct environment variables set.
       Use a subshell to not polute the normal environment.

         BINARY_SSH='ssh-add' /path/to/ssh-ident -I <identity>; # uppercase -I to load all keys if necessary
         ( . ~/.ssh/agents/agent-<identity>-${HOSTNAME} >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; <program that does not use the ssh binaries>; )`


    Config file with multiple identities
    ====================================

    To have multiple identities, all I have to do is:

    1) create a ~/.ssh-ident file. In this file, I need to tell ssh-ident which
       identities to use and when. The file should look something like:

      # Specifies which identity to use depending on the path I'm running ssh
      # from.
      # For example: ("mod-xslt", "personal") means that for any path that
      # contains the word "mod-xslt", the "personal" identity should be used.
      # This is optional - don't include any MATCH_PATH if you don't need it.
      MATCH_PATH = [
        # [directory pattern, identity]
        [r"mod-xslt", "personal"],
        [r"ssh-ident", "personal"],
        [r"opt/work", "work"],
        [r"opt/private", "secret"],
      ]

      # Specifies which identity to use depending on the arguments I'm running
      # ssh with. At first each element is separately tested against all patterns,
      # then a string of all elements is tested against all patterns.
      # This is optional - don't include any MATCH_ARGV if you don't need it.
      # For example: If any of the ssh arguments have 'cweb' in it, the 'personal'
      # identity has to be used. "ssh myhost.cweb.com" will have cweb in argv, and
      # the "personal" identity will be used.
      MATCH_ARGV = [
        [r"cweb", "personal"],
        [r"corp", "work"],
      ]
      # Another example: Choose an identity for git depending on the accessed
      # repository on GitHub (similar for GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
      # Recognize the elements with the host and the repository path to switch
      # between 'personal' and 'work' identity.
      MATCH_ARGV = [
        [r"\s(git@)?github\.com\s.*'company\/.+\.git'", "work"],
        [r"\s(git@)?github\.com\s.*'ccontavalli\/.+\.git'", "personal"],
        [r"\s(git@)?gist\.github\.com\s.*'abcdef01234567890fedcba912345678\.git'", "work"],
        [r"^(git@)?(gist\.)?github\.com$", "personal"],
      ]

      # Note that if no match is found, the DEFAULT_IDENTITY is used. This is
      # generally your loginname, no need to change it.
      # This is optional - don't include any DEFAULT_IDENTITY if you don't
      # need it.
      # DEFAULT_IDENTITY = "foo"

      # Set this to the name of an environment variable to force
      # the identity to the value of the variable
      # "ENVIRONMENT_IDENTITY": 'SSHIDENTITY',

      # This is optional - don't include any SSH_ADD_OPTIONS if you don't
      # need it.
      # Otherwise, provides options to be passed to the ssh-add command for
      # specific identities and/or binaries. First fitting entry wins.
      # First element is a list of identities, second element is a list of
      # binaries and third element is the option string.
      # An empty list means for all identities or all binaries.
      SSH_ADD_OPTIONS = [
        # Regardless, ask for confirmation before using any of the
        # work keys.
        [ ["work", ], [], "-c -t 3600"],
        # Forget about secret keys after ten minutes. ssh-ident will
        # automatically ask for the passphrase again if they are needed.
        [ ["secret", ], ['other-ssh-add', ], "-t 600"],
        # As default prevent keys remaining in memory for too long (>2h) for all
        # identities and binaries. Set SSH_ADD_OPTIONS to empty to disable this.
        [ [], [], "-t 7200"],
      ]

      # This is optional - dont' include any SSH_OPTIONS if you don't
      # need it.
      # Note that a separate ssh config file per identity is possible too.
      # Otherwise, provides options to be passed to the ssh command for
      # specific identities and/or binaries. All fitting entries combined.
      # First element is a list of identities, second element is a list of
      # binaries and third element is the option string.
      # An empty list means for all identities or all binaries.
      SSH_OPTIONS = [
        # As default pass UseRoaming=no to standard ssh binaries for all identities,
        # due to CVE-2016-0777. Set SSH_OPTIONS to empty to disable this.
        [ [], ['ssh', 'scp', 'sftp', ], "-oUseRoaming=no"],

        # Disable forwarding of the agent, but enable X forwarding,
        # when using the work or personal profile.
        [["work", "personal", ], ["ssh", ], "-Xa"],

        # Always forward the agent when using the secret identity.
        [["secret", ], ["ssh", ], "-A"],

        # Make all commands verbose for "personal"
        [["personal", ], [], "-v"],
      ]

      # This is optional - don't include any SSH_AGENTS or SSH_ADDS if you
      # don't need it. Defaults are 'ssh-agent' and 'ssh-add'.
      # Otherwise, provides ssh-agent/ssh-add binary to use for key handling
      # of specific identities. First fitting entry wins.
      # Those binaries most be compatible to OpenSSH's implementation.
      # First element is a list of identities and second element is the
      # ssh-agent/ssh-add binary name.
      # An empty list means for all identities.
      "SSH_AGENTS" = [
        [ ['work', 'work2', ], "other-ssh-agent"],
        [ ['secret', ], "ssh-pageant"],
      ],
      "SSH_ADDS" = [
        [ ['work1', 'work2', ], "other-ssh-add"],
      ],

      # Output verbosity
      # valid values are: LOG_ERROR, LOG_WARN, LOG_INFO, LOG_DEBUG
      VERBOSITY = LOG_INFO

    2) Create the directory where all the identities and agents
       will be kept:

        $ mkdir -p ~/.ssh/identities; chmod u=rwX,go= -R ~/.ssh

    3) Create a directory for each identity, for example:

        $ mkdir -p ~/.ssh/identities/personal
        $ mkdir -p ~/.ssh/identities/work
        $ mkdir -p ~/.ssh/identities/secret

    4) Generate (or copy) keys for those identities:

        # Default keys are for my personal account
        $ cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa* ~/.ssh/identities/personal

        # Generate keys to be used for work only, rsa
        $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/identities/work/id_rsa

    5) Optionally create a separate ssh config file for those identities that
       need special ssh settings in general or for specific hosts:

        $ ${EDITOR} ~/.ssh/identities/secret/config

        ...

    Now if I run:

      $ ssh corp.mywemployer.com

    ssh-ident will be invoked instead, and:

      1) check ssh argv, determine that the "work" identity has to be used.
      2) look in ~/.ssh/agents, for a "work" agent loaded. If there is no
         agent, it will prepare one.
      3) look in ~/.ssh/identities/work/* for a list of keys to load for this
         identity. It will try to load any key that is not already loaded in
         the agent.
      4) finally run ssh with the environment setup such that it will have
         access only to the agent for the identity work, and the corresponding
         keys.

    Notes about key files:
    ssh-ident needs to access both files of each key pair - private and public key.
    Both files have to reside in the same directory.
    All files in your identities subdirectories that match PATTERN_KEYS will be
    considered key files (either private or public). If a different naming scheme
    is used, then make sure that PATTERN_KEYS matches filenames for both types.
    By default ssh-ident identifies public keys by the .pub extension or
    a "public" inside the filename, while private keys have no explicit extension
    or a "private" inside the filename. To recognize a key pair these specific name
    parts are removed, the remaining filenames compared and connected if they match.
    A key is only recognized and loaded if the key pair is complete.
    The public key file is necessary to detect if a key is already loaded into
    ssh-agent to avoid adding it again and therefore asking for password again.
    If a public key file is missing check out the '-y' parameter of 'ssh-keygen'.
    All patterns to detect key files in general plus public and private keys are
    defined in lists, which can hold multiple regular expressions or simple
    compare strings. The first match is taken and no further tests done.
    Patterns are tested against the filename, not the full path.

    The defaults of PATTERN_KEYS against the filename for the general key file
    determination are:

          PATTERN_KEYS = [
            r"^id_",
            r"^identity",
            r"^ssh[0-9]-",
          ]

    The defaults of PATTERN_PUBKEYS and PATTERN_PRIVKEYS for the public and private
    key determination are:

          PATTERN_PUBKEYS = [
              [r"\.pub$", 0],
              [r"public", 0],
          ]
          PATTERN_PRIVKEYS = [
              [r"private", 0],
              # Fallback for all remaining files.
              [r"", None],
          ]

    Notes about PATTERN_PUBKEYS and PATTERN_PRIVKEYS:
    ssh-ident first checks if the file is a public key, then if it is a private key.
    The second parameter after the patterns defines which group to remove to
    recognize key pairs. A zero (0) means remove the whole match. 'None' means do
    not remove anything and leave filename as is.

    If you want to only load keys that have "mykey" in their filename, you can
    define in your .ssh-ident:

          PATTERN_KEYS = [
            "mykey",
          ]

    If you want to also load keys that have the extension ".key" or ".pub", then
    you can define in your .ssh-ident:

          PATTERN_KEYS = [
            r"^id_",
            r"^identity",
            r"^ssh[0-9]-",
            r"(\.key|\.pub)$",
          ]
          PATTERN_PRIVKEYS = [
              [r"\.key$", 0],
              [r"private", 0],
              # Fallback for all remaining files.
              [r"", None],
          ]

    Note: As the ".pub" and ".key" patterns come first, files that also have
    "public" or "private" in their names may not match.


    You can also redefine:

          DIR_IDENTITIES = "$HOME/.ssh/identities"
          DIR_AGENTS = "$HOME/.ssh/agents"

    To point somewhere else if you so desire.


    TROUBLESHOOTING
    ===============

    If something does not work as wanted then enable verbose mode for the
    target binary, for example '-v' for ssh.
    Additionally remove the keys for the identity and set ssh-ident's
    VERBOSITY to LOG_DEBUG.

      BINARY_SSH='ssh-add' /path/to/ssh-ident -i <identity> -D; # delete all keys from agent of identity
      VERBOSITY='LOG_DEBUG' ssh -vT git@github.com "test 'my-git-user-1/test-repo.git'"

    Check that the correct keys are available for each identity (public and
    private) and that the configuration matches the scenario (binary, parameters, etc.).


    BUILDING A DEBIAN PACKAGE
    =========================

    If you need to use ssh-ident on a debian / ubuntu / or any other
    derivate, you can now build debian packages.

      1. Make sure you have devscripts installed:

        sudo apt-get install devscripts debhelper

      2. Download ssh-ident in a directory of your choice (ssh-ident)

        git clone https://github.com/ccontavalli/ssh-ident.git ssh-ident

      3. Build the .deb package:

        cd ssh-ident && debuild -us -uc

      4. Profit:

        cd ..; dpkg -i ssh-ident*.deb

FUNCTIONS
    AutodetectBinary(runtime_name, config, binary_checks)
        Detects the correct binaries to run and sets BINARY_SSH* accordingly,
        if it is not already set.

    FindExecutable(executable, path=None)

    FindIdentity(argv, config)
        Returns the identity to use based on current directory or argv.

        Args:
          argv: iterable of string, argv passed to this program.
          config: instance of an object implementing the same interface as
              the Config class.

        Returns:
          string, the name of the identity to use.

    FindIdentityInList(elements, identities, all_elements, array_name)
        Matches a list of identities to a list of elements.

        Args:
          elements: iterable of strings, arbitrary strings to match on.
          identities: iterable of (string, string), with first string
            being a regular expression, the second string being an identity.
          all_elements: boolean if to check against string of all elements
          array_name: name of the patterns array

        Returns:
          The identity specified in identities for the first regular expression
          matching the first element in elements.

    FindKeys(identity, config)
        Finds all the private and public keys associated with an identity.

        Args:
          identity: string, name of the identity to load strings of.
          config: object implementing the Config interface, providing configurations
              for the user.

        Returns:
          dict, {"key name": {"pub": "/path/to/public/key", "priv":
          "/path/to/private/key"}}, for each key found, the path of the public
          key and private key. The key name is just a string representing the
          key. Note that for a given key, it is not guaranteed that both the
          public and private key will be found.
          The return value is affected by DIR_IDENTITIES and PATTERN_KEYS
          configuration parameters.

    FindSSHConfig(identity, config)
        Finds a config file if there's one associated with an identity

        Args:
          identity: string, name of the identity to load strings of.
          config: object implementing the Config interface, providing configurations
              for the user.

        Returns:
          string, the configuration file to use

    GetSessionTty()
        Returns a file descriptor for the session TTY, or None.

        In *nix systems, each process is tied to one session. Each
        session can be tied (or not) to a terminal, "/dev/tty".

        Additionally, when a command is run, its stdin or stdout can
        be any file descriptor, including one that represent a tty.

        So for example:

          ./test.sh < /dev/null > /dev/null

        will have stdin and stdout tied to /dev/null - but does not
        tell us anything about the session having a /dev/tty associated
        or not.

        For example, running

          ssh -t user@remotehost './test.sh < /dev/null > /dev/null'

        have a tty associated, while the same command without -t will not.

        When ssh is invoked by tools like git or rsync, its stdin and stdout
        is often tied to a file descriptor which is not a terminal, has
        the tool wants to provide the input and process the output.

        ssh-ident internally has to invoke ssh-add, which needs to know if
        it has any terminal it can use at all.

        This function returns an open file if the session has an usable terminal,
        None otherwise.

    ParseCommandLine(argv, config, binary)
        Parses the command line parameters in argv
        and modifies config accordingly.

    ShouldPrint(config, loglevel)
        Returns true if a message by the specified loglevel should be printed.

    main(argv)
